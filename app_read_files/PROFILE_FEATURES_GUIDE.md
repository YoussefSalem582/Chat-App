## üîê Security & Permissions

### Required Permissions

**Android (`android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`):**
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
```

**iOS (`ios/Runner/Info.plist`):**
```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need camera access to take profile pictures</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need photo library access to select profile pictures</string>
```

### Firebase Storage Rules

Recommended security rules for Firebase Storage:
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /profile_images/{userId}/{fileName} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      allow delete: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```

### Firestore Security Rules

Update Firestore rules to allow profile updates:
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /Users/{userId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```

## üìä Statistics Calculation

### How Stats are Calculated

**Messages Count:**
1. Find all chat rooms where user is a participant
2. Count messages in each room where senderID matches current user
3. Sum total across all chat rooms

**Contacts Count:**
1. Find all chat rooms where user is a participant
2. Extract all other participants (excluding current user)
3. Count unique participants

**Implementation Note:** Stats are calculated in real-time, which may be slow for users with many chats. Consider implementing caching or incremental counters for better performance.

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

1. **Image Cropping**
   - Add image cropping tool before upload
   - Allow users to adjust image framing

2. **Multiple Images**
   - Photo gallery feature

3. **Profile Verification**
   - Blue check mark for verified accounts
   - Email verification requirement

4. **Privacy Controls**
   - Hide online status
   - Profile visibility settings
   - Who can see profile picture

5. **Profile Themes**
   - Custom profile backgrounds
   - Color themes for profile page

6. **Social Features**
   - Profile views counter
   - Last profile update timestamp
   - Mutual contacts display
