# üêõ Bug Fix: Chat Screen Loading Message

## Issue Description
When typing in the chat screen, an annoying "Loading messages..." indicator would appear, interrupting the user experience.

## Root Cause
The `StreamBuilder` for messages was showing the loading indicator whenever `ConnectionState.waiting` was true. This happened not only during initial load but also whenever the stream emitted new data or updates, including:
- When typing status changes
- When new messages arrive
- When message status updates
- Any stream rebuild

## Solution
Changed the loading condition to only show the loading indicator on **initial load** when there's no data yet:

### Before
```dart
// loading
if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
  return const LoadingIndicator(message: "Loading messages...");
}
```

### After
```dart
// loading - only show on initial load when there's no data yet
if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting &&
    !snapshot.hasData) {
  return const LoadingIndicator(message: "Loading messages...");
}
```

## Impact
‚úÖ **Fixed:** Loading message no longer appears when typing
‚úÖ **Fixed:** Smooth experience during real-time updates
‚úÖ **Preserved:** Loading indicator still shows on first load
‚úÖ **Preserved:** All other functionality remains intact

## Technical Details

### StreamBuilder Behavior
- `ConnectionState.waiting` - Stream is active but waiting for data
- `ConnectionState.active` - Stream is active and has emitted data
- `ConnectionState.done` - Stream has completed

### The Fix
By adding `&& !snapshot.hasData` condition:
- **Initial Load:** `waiting` + no data = Show loading ‚úÖ
- **Has Data + Waiting:** `waiting` + has data = Skip loading ‚úÖ
- **Typing/Updates:** Stream rebuilds but data exists = No loading ‚úÖ

## Testing
- ‚úÖ Verified loading shows on first chat open
- ‚úÖ Verified no loading when typing
- ‚úÖ Verified no loading when receiving messages
- ‚úÖ Verified smooth real-time updates
- ‚úÖ No compilation errors

## Files Modified
- `lib/pages/chat_page.dart` - Line ~645

## Result
**Perfect user experience** - No interruptions while typing or during real-time message updates!
