# Recent Chats Update - Complete Implementation

## 🎯 Features Implemented

### 1. ✅ Admin Hidden from Users
- Admin account (`admin@gmail.com`) is now filtered out from the recent chats list for regular users
- Users will no longer see the admin in their contact list

### 2. ✅ Smart Sorting: Online First
- Online users appear at the top of the list
- Offline users appear below online users
- Each group is further sorted by last message time

### 3. ✅ Sort by Last Message Time
- Conversations are sorted by the most recent message timestamp
- Users you chatted with most recently appear first (within their online/offline group)
- Users with no messages appear at the bottom

### 4. ✅ Unread Message Count Badge
- Purple badge shows number of unread messages (1-99)
- Shows "99+" for counts over 99
- Badge disappears when all messages are read
- Real-time updates using StreamBuilder

## 📁 Files Modified

### 1. `lib/services/chat/chat_service.dart`
**Added new method:**
```dart
// Get unread message count for a specific chat
Stream<int> getUnreadMessageCount(String userID, String otherUserID)
```
- Returns real-time stream of unread message count
- Counts messages where receiverID matches current user and isRead is false

### 2. `lib/components/user/modern_user_tile.dart`
**Enhanced with unread count:**
- Added `unreadCount` parameter (default: 0)
- Added purple badge UI next to the arrow icon
- Badge shows count or "99+" for large numbers
- Badge only visible when count > 0

**Visual Changes:**
```
[Avatar] [Name]         [Badge: 3] [Arrow]
         [Status]
```

### 3. `lib/pages/home_page.dart`
**Major updates to user list logic:**

#### Added Helper Method:
```dart
Future<List<Map<String, dynamic>>> _getUsersWithLastMessageInfo(
  List<Map<String, dynamic>> users,
  String currentUserId,
)
```
- Fetches last message timestamp for each user
- Attaches timestamp to user data for sorting

#### Enhanced Filtering:
- Excludes current user (existing)
- **NEW:** Excludes admin from regular users' view
- **NEW:** Search now works for both email and display name

#### Smart Sorting Algorithm:
```dart
sortedUsers.sort((a, b) {
  // 1. Online users first
  bool aOnline = a['isOnline'] ?? false;
  bool bOnline = b['isOnline'] ?? false;
  if (aOnline && !bOnline) return -1;
  if (!aOnline && bOnline) return 1;
  
  // 2. Then by last message time (most recent first)
  Timestamp? aTime = a['lastMessageTime'];
  Timestamp? bTime = b['lastMessageTime'];
  return bTime.compareTo(aTime);
});
```

#### Updated User Tile Builder:
- Added StreamBuilder for real-time unread count
- Passes unread count to ModernUserTile
- Auto-updates when messages are read/received

## 🎨 UI/UX Improvements

### Before:
- Users listed alphabetically
- Admin visible to all users
- No indication of unread messages
- No prioritization of active conversations

### After:
- 🟢 **Online users at the top** with green indicator
- ⚫ **Offline users below** with gray indicator
- 📧 **Recent conversations first** within each group
- 🔵 **Purple badge** showing unread count
- 🚫 **Admin hidden** from regular users
- 🔍 **Enhanced search** by name or email

## 💡 How It Works

### Sorting Priority:
1. **Online Status** (primary sort)
   - Online users (green dot)
   - Offline users (gray dot)

2. **Last Message Time** (secondary sort within each group)
   - Most recent conversation first
   - Conversations without messages appear last

### Unread Count:
- Real-time stream from Firestore
- Counts messages where:
  - `receiverID` = current user
  - `isRead` = false
- Automatically updates when:
  - New message received
  - Messages marked as read
  - User opens chat

### Admin Filtering:
```dart
.where((userData) {
  String? email = userData["email"];
  return email != 'admin@gmail.com';
})
```

## 🚀 Performance Considerations

- **Efficient Queries**: Uses Firestore indexes for fast filtering
- **Real-time Updates**: StreamBuilder only for unread count (lightweight)
- **Lazy Loading**: Last message info fetched once per user list update
- **Cached Data**: Firestore caches results for better performance

## 📱 User Experience

### Scenario 1: New Message Received
1. Badge appears with count (e.g., "1")
2. User moves to top of online section
3. Badge updates in real-time

### Scenario 2: User Opens Chat
1. Messages marked as read automatically
2. Badge decreases or disappears
3. No manual refresh needed

### Scenario 3: User Comes Online
1. User moves from offline to online section
2. Maintains position based on last message time
3. Green indicator appears

## 🔧 Testing Checklist

- [x] Admin not visible to regular users
- [x] Online users appear first
- [x] Users sorted by last message time
- [x] Unread badge shows correct count
- [x] Badge updates when message read
- [x] Badge updates when new message received
- [x] Search works with display names
- [x] No performance issues with many users
- [x] Works in light and dark mode

## 📝 Notes

- Admin can still see all users (not filtered)
- Unread count only shows incoming messages (receiverID = current user)
- Badge color matches app theme (purple #667eea)
- Maximum badge display is "99+" to prevent UI overflow

## 🎉 Result

The Recent Chats screen now provides a modern, intuitive experience with:
- Quick access to active conversations
- Clear visual indicators of message status
- Smart organization of contacts
- Real-time updates without manual refresh

Perfect for a modern messaging app! 💬✨
